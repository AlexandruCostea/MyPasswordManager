# Secure Password Manager

Secure Password Manager is a Java application designed to provide users with a secure and convenient way to manage their passwords locally without the need for third-party involvement. 
Instead of relying on an online database, the passwords are encrypted and stored locally on the user's device, enhancing privacy and security. 
The application offers various functionalities such as managing existing passwords, generating random secure passwords, and exporting data in PDF format.
It is important to note that exporting data to PDF should be done with caution as it introduces potential vulnerabilities. 
It is recommended to use this feature only for printing and storing data in a safe space.
